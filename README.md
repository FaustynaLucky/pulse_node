setup script to run a pulsechain-testnet node + validator (lighthouse)

chmod +x
run script with sudo

validator script still WIP (only lighthouse atm - works since v.1.0.1 from pulse-devs)

to update the docker images (should pulse-devs update stuff) - you can run the watchtower.sh, or the stop-docker / update-docker scripts.
