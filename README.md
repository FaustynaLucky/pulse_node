setup script to run a pulsechain-testnet node + validator (lighthouse)

chmod +x
run script with sudo
validator script still WIP (only lighthouse atm - woks since v.1.0.1 from pulse-devs)

to update the docker images-cache (should pulse-devs update stuff) - you can run the stop-docker / update-docker scripts.
